# scripts/gh/labels.sh: bootstrap the FerroCHART issue-label taxonomy.
#
# Creates (idempotently) the labels the tracker workflow assumes:
#   * exactly one TYPE label per issue, mapped to the conventional-commit types
#     (bug/enhancement/documentation/chore/refactor/perf/test/ci);
#   * a PRIORITY (P0 to P3);
#   * the DOMAIN labels, one per conformance surface;
#   * a few workflow labels.
#
# `gh label create --force` updates an existing label in place, so re-running
# this is safe and converges the colours and descriptions to the values below.
# Run it ONCE after the repository is created (owner action).
#
# Taxonomy policy: .claude/rules/issue-workflow.md
# Official docs: https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_label_create
#
# Usage: scripts/gh/labels.sh
