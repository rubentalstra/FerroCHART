# /phase-done

The closing step of the issue workflow (`.claude/rules/issue-workflow.md`). Run
it only once the issue's work is actually finished; this skill verifies and
records, and it does not decide the work is done on your behalf.

## Steps

1. **Identify the issue being closed** (the user names it, or it is the issue
   this branch's PR declares `Closes #N` for). Read it with
   `gh issue view <n> --comments`.
2. **Verify every `## Acceptance criteria` checkbox is ticked.** If any remain
   `- [ ]`, stop and list them. Do not tick a criterion yourself to proceed; a
   tick must reflect real, verified state (once a workspace exists, "the
   workspace builds" means someone ran `cargo build --workspace` and it
   succeeded). Tick verified boxes in the issue body via
   `gh issue edit <n> --body-file`.
3. **Relationships check** (`scripts/gh/rel.sh tree <n>`;
   `.claude/rules/issue-relationships.md`): if the issue is a **parent** with
   **open sub-issues**, do NOT close it; finish or re-parent the children
   first. Closing this issue auto-unblocks anything it was `blocking`, which is
   expected; note any dependents that become workable so the handoff comment
   can point at them.
4. **Spec-adherence check:** for work that shipped spec-facing behaviour,
   confirm it was checked against the governing specification (`/spec-lookup`,
   `.claude/rules/spec-adherence.md`) and that the decisions carry citations.
   If that never happened, stop and say so; it is an unmet exit criterion in
   spirit.
5. **Research-issue check:** for a design-phase research issue, confirm the
   deliverable is on the issue thread as cited evidence and a recommendation,
   not as an undocumented conclusion. If the issue was supposed to produce or
   update `docs/architecture.md`, confirm it did.
6. **Gate check:** confirm the gates that apply actually ran and passed. Before
   the workspace exists that is the shell and workflow set (`shellcheck
   --severity=style`, `actionlint`, `zizmor`) plus
   `scripts/checks/comment-style.sh`; afterwards it is the full Rust set in
   `.claude/rules/ci-cd.md`. Report the results you saw, never a green you
   assumed.
7. **Changelog check:** a change with user-visible effect has an entry under
   `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`. Add it if it is missing.
8. **Write the close narrative into the PR description:** what shipped, the key
   decisions with their citations, the gate results, and what was deliberately
   left out (with follow-up issue numbers). The PR description plus the issue
   thread ARE the build record.
9. **Post the handoff comment on the issue** (`gh issue comment <n>`): where
   things stand at close, what was deliberately left out (with follow-up issue
   numbers), and what a follow-up session should do first.
10. **Ensure the PR body declares `Closes #<n>`** (`gh pr view`, `gh pr edit`)
    so the merge into `main` auto-closes the issue; never close the issue by
    hand when a PR carries the work. One `Closes` keyword per issue.
11. **Roadmap-board check** (`.claude/rules/project-board.md`): `Done` is set
    by the built-in workflow when the merge closes the issue, never by hand.
    After the merge, `scripts/gh/project.sh show <n>` should say `Done`; if the
    issue is missing from the board entirely, `scripts/gh/project.sh add <n>`
    and let the closed-to-Done workflow settle it. Do not archive or delete
    board items.
12. **Remind the user to commit** the close on the current conventional-type
    branch.

## What this skill does not do

It does not run the build, the test suite, or the guards to "check" the
acceptance criteria for you; those must already have been run and have passed
before this skill is invoked. If in doubt, run the relevant command first.
