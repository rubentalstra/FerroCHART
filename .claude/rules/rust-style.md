# Rust style: idiomatic application code

Applies to every hand-written `.rs` file in the repository. **The form compiler
and the composition builder are modern idiomatic Rust of our own design**,
built on whatever generated model the research on issue #1 settles
(`codegen.md`). The openEHR Reference Model, Archetype Object Model, ITS-REST,
and AQL specifications are the authority; Better Form Builder, Medblocks UI,
and the form tooling around EHRbase are prior art only.

**Generated files are off-limits.** Every `// @generated` file is produced by a
generator: change the generator and regenerate, never the output. Full
generation discipline: `codegen.md`.

## Build idiomatic, compiling, tested code

- **Consume the generated Reference Model types directly.** Never re-model or
  re-serialise a COMPOSITION by hand.
- **Use proper crates; do not hand-roll** what the ecosystem provides (the HTTP
  server and client, YAML and JSON parsing, JSON Schema validation, time,
  tracing). Add dependencies through the root `Cargo.toml
  [workspace.dependencies]` table (`dep.workspace = true`), and verify each
  version against crates.io or docs.rs at the moment it is added, never from
  memory.
- **Every crate you touch compiles, is clippy-clean, and is tested before you
  move on.**
- **Read the governing specification first for any spec-facing behaviour:** the
  Reference Model class, the Archetype Object Model section that gives a
  constraint its meaning, the ITS-REST section, or the AQL section (`spec-adherence.md`, `/spec-lookup`).
- **The specifications are the authority; design the bespoke logic ourselves**
  (the template flattener, the field derivation, the composition builder, the
  terminology binding). Consult prior art when useful; never port it blindly.

## Comments and documentation

The comment and doc-comment discipline lives in **`comments.md`** (RFC 505 plus
RFC 1574): line comments only, `// TODO(#NNNN):` / `// NOTE:` / `// SAFETY:` as
the only markers, NOTE as a citation plus one sentence (at most 3 lines), `//`
runs at most 8 lines, doc-comment summary-line and section conventions.
Enforced by `scripts/checks/comment-style.sh` (hook) and
`clippy::too_long_first_doc_paragraph`.

## Default values live in the struct's `Default` impl (RFC 3681 shape)

The shape is RFC 3681's
(<https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3681-default-field-values.html>), written by
hand: **one** `impl Default` per struct, every default value inline, and
container-level `#[serde(default)]` so serde fills omitted fields from it.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Deserialize)]
#[serde(default, deny_unknown_fields)]
pub struct MappingOptions {
    pub strict: bool,
    pub max_depth: usize,
}

impl Default for MappingOptions {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            strict: true,
            max_depth: 64,
        }
    }
}
```

The RFC's own syntax (`strict: bool = true`) is **nightly-only** (feature
`default_field_values`, tracking issue
<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/132162>), and this project pins
stable, so the expansion above is the form we write. Do not reach for nightly
to get it.

Three forms are banned, because each one puts a field's default value
somewhere other than the field's own struct:

- **`#[serde(default = "path")]`:** the per-field path form. The default then
  lives in a function, so `Default::default()` and a deserialized value can
  disagree about the same field with no warning. Container-level
  `#[serde(default)]` (no path) is the required form and reads the one
  `Default` impl.
- **`fn default_x() -> T`:** a zero-argument constructor that exists to be one
  field's default.
- **`const DEFAULT_X` with a single reader:** a constant that nothing shares is
  a default value spelled far from its struct.

A `const` with MORE THAN ONE consumer stays a constant and may be referenced
from inside the `Default` impl.

## HTTP statuses are compared as types

An HTTP status is a `StatusCode`, and it is compared as one:

```rust
if status == StatusCode::OK { … }          // yes
if status.as_u16() == 200 { … }            // no
```

`http::StatusCode` names every registered code, so there is always a constant.
A numeric comparison throws away the type the crate exists to provide, and a
bare literal tells a reader nothing about which member of a family was meant:
`403` versus `404` is a one-character typo the compiler cannot catch. Rendering
the number (a log field, a metric label) stays legal; only comparison against a
numeric literal is refused. This bites hard here, because FerroCHART reads
statuses from a CDR and a terminology server and maps them onto its own
responses.

## RFC-grounded conventions

| RFC | The rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| 0505 + 1574 | comment and doc conventions | `comments.md` + `scripts/checks/comment-style.sh` + `too_long_first_doc_paragraph` |
| 3681 | a field's default lives inline in its `Default` impl | §Default values above |
| 3107 | `#[derive(Default)]` + `#[default]` where the default is a VARIANT | `clippy::derivable_impls` (deny); hand-write `impl Default` only for VALUES |
| 0199 / 0344 / 0430 | `as_`/`to_`/`into_` cost conventions, naming | `clippy::wrong_self_convention` + rustc naming lints |
| 1940 | `#[must_use]` on functions whose result is the point | `clippy::must_use_candidate` (pedantic) |
| 2383 | every suppression carries `reason = "…"` | `clippy::allow_attributes_without_reason` (deny) |
| 1946 | intra-doc links over bare paths | `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links` (deny) + the CI doc job |
| 0201 / 0344 | an error carries its cause (`Error::source`) | `#[source]`/`#[from]` on every wrapping variant; review-enforced |

The lints named above are configured in the root `Cargo.toml
[workspace.lints]` when the workspace is stood up; until then they are the
standing bar for hand-written code.

## Type and error conventions

- `thiserror` error enums in library crates; `anyhow` only in a binary. No
  `unwrap`/`expect` outside `#[cfg(test)]`; `todo!()` and `unimplemented!()`
  are banned: an unready dependency gets a typed error or real code, never a
  panic placeholder.
- Model closed sets as Rust `enum`s; trait objects only for genuinely open,
  runtime polymorphism.
- Back-references use `Weak<..>` or an index, never an owning reference;
  recursive containment is boxed.
- `std::sync::LazyLock` (edition 2024) for statics, not `once_cell`.
- **No `use X as Y` import renaming.** Import types under their direct names.
  An alias papers over a naming problem: if the name is bad, FIX THE NAME at
  its definition; if two imports genuinely collide, qualify one at the use site
  (full path) instead of renaming. Only alias in highly exceptional cases where
  no other solution exists, with a comment saying why. (A trait import as
  `use Trait as _;` is not a rename and is fine.)
- Edition 2024, resolver v3. `cargo fmt` clean; run `cargo clippy` on the crate
  you touched before considering it done.
- **Suppressions are `#[expect(lint, reason = "…")]`**, scoped to the smallest
  item; `#[allow(lint, reason = "…")]` only for configuration-conditional fire
  (full policy: `reliability.md`).

## Documentation (`missing_docs` is enforced workspace-wide)

- Every public item carries a doc comment (rustc `missing_docs`; a generated
  crate gets its docs from the emitter, and a `// @generated` file is never
  hand-edited). Shape, sections, and summary-line rules: `comments.md`
  (RFC 1574).
- Intra-doc links (`[`Type`]`) resolve in the scope of the module where the
  item is DEFINED. `rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links` is deny; the CI doc job is
  the gate. Literal square brackets in prose are escaped `\[…\]`.

## Edition-2024 standing guidance (behaviour that compiles fine and differs)

- **`if let` scrutinee temporaries drop before `else`:** the guard rule lives in
  `reliability.md`; rewrite as `match` when a guard must span arms.
- **Never-type fallback**: `f()?;` on a function generic over the `Ok` type can
  now infer `!`; annotate the turbofish or binding type at such call sites
  instead of leaning on inference.
- **RPIT captures every in-scope lifetime by default:** when a returned
  `impl Trait` must NOT capture one, say so with precise capturing (`use<…>`).
- **`Future` and `IntoFuture` are in the prelude:** a collision with a local
  trait method is resolved with fully-qualified syntax, never an import rename.
- The `unsafe_*` 2024 items are all moot under `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.

## Naming

A name says what the thing is in its domain, never which language, layer, or
pipeline stage produced it. Spec-defined things keep the specification's names
verbatim (`StructureDefinition`, `OperationDefinition`, the mapping keys each
mapping specification defines),
FHIR camelCase becoming Rust snake_case for fields. When two views of one thing
would collide, the module path disambiguates (`fhir::` versus `omop::`),
never a prefix. Modules are named for their contents, verbs only for a stage
that is genuinely a transformation (`lower`, `render`, `emit`).

## No Python, anywhere

The tooling languages are **bash and Rust**. Python is banned across the
repository, in standalone scripts, and especially embedded in shell (a heredoc
nested inside a command substitution makes bash scan the *Python* for quote
pairs, so a single apostrophe breaks the whole script while pointing at the
wrong line). Reach for:

| Job | Tool |
|---|---|
| JSON read and build | `jq` |
| Line scans, field extraction | `awk`, `sed`, `grep` |
| Anything with real data structures | Rust, in a tool crate |

## What not to do

- Do not port JVM or TypeScript plumbing from EHRbase, Better Form Builder, or
  Medblocks UI. Design
  the idiomatic Rust equivalent, or register it as its own tracker issue with a
  `// TODO(#NNNN):`.
- Do not hand-edit generated code, and do not re-model what a generated crate
  already provides.
- Do not hand-code a form per template, or a field per archetype. A form is
  derived from the operational template by the compiler, which is the product's
  central premise.
