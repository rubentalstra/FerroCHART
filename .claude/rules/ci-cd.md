# CI/CD and supply-chain discipline

No specification governs this: our own design, grounded in the OWASP GitHub
Actions Security Cheat Sheet, SLSA v1.0, OpenSSF Scorecard, and Sigstore.

## What runs today

Six workflows:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: the two-tier gate. Tier 1 runs now (zizmor,
  actionlint, shellcheck, hadolint, the comment-style guard, the versions
  guard); tier 2 is the Rust set, gated behind a `detect` job that looks for a
  root `Cargo.toml`. The `conclusion` job is the single required status check
  on `main`. The design is `docs/ci-cd.md`.
- `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`: OpenSSF Scorecard, an independent score of
  the repository's security posture, published to the OpenSSF API and to code
  scanning.
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`: CodeQL over the `actions` language, because
  the workflows in this directory are code that holds tokens. The Rust
  analysis is behind a detection job that looks for a root `Cargo.toml`, so it
  activated with the workspace and analyses Rust now.
- `.github/workflows/sonar.yml`: SonarQube Cloud, the multi-language sweep over
  shell, YAML, and JSON. Advisory, gating no merge (`ai-code-review.md`). The
  instrumented coverage run and the `sonar.projectVersion` derivation sit
  sat behind a `hashFiles('Cargo.toml')` step gate and report now that the
  workspace landed, so the Rust analysis and the coverage import run now.
- `.github/workflows/docs.yml`: the documentation lane. It renders the book
  under `website/book` with the pinned toolchain that
  `.github/actions/docs-toolchain` installs, uploads it as a Pages artifact on
  every event, and deploys only on a push to `main` or a dispatch. A pull
  request verifies the book and never publishes it. The custom domain is a
  Pages setting rather than a committed `CNAME` file.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: the release lane, dormant until a `v*` tag
  is pushed. It validates the tag, checks it against every file that declares
  the product version, takes the release notes from the matching
  `CHANGELOG.md` section, creates the release as a draft, and publishes only
  after the expected asset set is complete. Its binary lane sits behind the
  same root-`Cargo.toml` detection, and it activated with the workspace. The
  checklist a cut follows is `docs/release.md`.

The Rust lanes in `ci.yml`, `codeql.yml` and `sonar.yml` were written gated
off and needed no edit when the workspace landed. `.github/dependabot.yml`
carries the same property: its `cargo` and `docker` entries are inert until
their manifests exist, and so does the binary lane of `release.yml`.
`.github/release.yml` is a different file from the workflow: it configures
GitHub's auto-generated release notes, which the lane never uses, because a
release ships the hand-curated changelog section or it fails.

## Workflow security (every workflow, no exceptions)

- **Every `uses:` is pinned to a full commit SHA** with a trailing `# vX.Y.Z`
  comment. Dependabot (`github-actions`) bumps them. A tag or branch ref is a
  finding.
- **`permissions: {}` at workflow level**, with the minimum granted per job.
- **`persist-credentials: false`** on every `actions/checkout` that does not
  push with git.
- **No `${{ }}` context interpolation inside `run:`:** pass context through
  `env:`. This prevents template injection.
- **A publishing lane restores no build cache.** A cache an untrusted run could
  poison must not feed a release.

**Enforcement:** `ci.yml` tier 1 runs `zizmor --min-severity=low .github/`,
`actionlint`, and `shellcheck --severity=style` on every push to `main`, pull
request, and merge-group run. Run the same three by hand before pushing a
workflow or script change, so a finding costs a local run rather than a CI
round trip. The zizmor path is the whole of `.github`, so `dependabot.yml` and
every composite action under `.github/actions/` are audited alongside the
workflows. Never narrow it back to make a finding disappear: fix the cause, or
record a `# zizmor: ignore[audit]` suppression with its reason on the line the
finding names.

## Shell scripts are analysed like code

The tooling languages here are bash and Rust (`rust-style.md` §No Python).
Every committed shell script stays clean at `shellcheck --severity=style`, its
lowest floor, so every finding gates. A finding is FIXED, or it carries a
per-line `# shellcheck disable=SCnnnn` directive with its reason on the same
line. A blanket exclusion is refused, and no `.shellcheckrc` exists, because a
file that can turn a code off tree-wide eventually does.

## Rust CI lanes (gated in `ci.yml`, activate with the Cargo workspace)

The lanes, with the local commands mirroring the CI
flags verbatim: `cargo fmt --all --check`; `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`; `cargo nextest run --workspace
--locked` plus `cargo test --doc --locked`; `cargo doc` with
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings`; `cargo deny check` (advisories, licences, bans,
sources, which subsumes cargo-audit); MSRV via `cargo hack check
--rust-version`; `dependency-review-action` on pull requests; and the
`comment-style.sh` guard at `--all`. **Always `--locked`**, so CI fails on
lockfile drift rather than on registry drift. Commit `Cargo.lock`.

## Supply chain (the shape a release lane takes)

- **A release builds in a REUSABLE workflow** (`on: workflow_call`) so the
  builder is isolated and the signing identity is unreachable from build steps.
  That isolation is what makes the provenance non-falsifiable. Do not inline
  the build and attest steps back into a normal job.
- **Every release artifact carries provenance and a signed SBOM**, signed
  keyless through Sigstore (`id-token: write`), and consumers verify with
  `gh attestation verify … --signer-workflow …`.
- **A release is assembled as a draft and published last**: create the draft,
  attach every asset, check the set is complete, then publish, so a
  half-assembled release is never visible. The fix for a bad cut is a new patch
  version, never a retag, and both halves are enforced: the immutable-releases
  setting freezes a published release's notes and assets, and the
  `release-tags` ruleset stops the tag being moved or deleted
  (`docs/release.md`).
- **A version pin has a single source of truth**, and a committed check fails
  on cross-file drift.
- **The library crates publish to crates.io through Trusted Publishing** (OIDC,
  no long-lived token), in dependency order, from a dispatch lane and from the
  release lane, with a dry run on every pull request and the codegen drift gates
  ahead of it, so a published generated crate never disagrees with its
  generator.

## Never

- Never unpin a `uses:` to a tag or branch, widen a job's permissions without
  cause, interpolate context into `run:`, or restore a cache in a publishing
  lane.
- Never weaken a gate to go green (`testing.md`); fix the cause.
- **Never add AI or Claude attribution** to any commit, PR, or release text.
