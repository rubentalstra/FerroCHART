# Reliability and safety hard rules (safety-critical Rust)

A bridge carries clinical data between systems: a mis-mapped field, a silently
dropped element, or a swallowed upstream error becomes a wrong record in the
receiving system. Silent wrong answers are worse than loud failures. The
principles below are the standing bar for hand-written code, and each names the
lint or check that enforces it. **A rule without a failing check is a wish**, so
when the Cargo workspace is stood up every lint here is wired into the root
`Cargo.toml [workspace.lints]` in the same change. Principles from the Rust API
Guidelines checklist, the Rust Book's error-handling and overflow chapters, and
the Clippy book.

## Enforcement tiers (strongest first)

1. **Compile property:** the type system makes the violation unrepresentable
   (newtypes, `#[must_use]`, sealed traits, `forbid`).
2. **Workspace lint at `deny`/`forbid`:** fails every `cargo clippy`, local and
   CI (`Cargo.toml [workspace.lints]`). `forbid` cannot be relaxed by any
   attribute; escaping it is an owner decision, not an `#[allow]`.
3. **Warn plus CI `-D warnings`:** `clippy::all` and `clippy::pedantic` both
   live here, so every pedantic lint is effectively a hard rule (including
   `missing_errors_doc` and `missing_panics_doc`).
4. **A committed check script or CI job:** currently
   `scripts/checks/comment-style.sh` and `scripts/checks/versions.sh` (both
   per-edit via a hook) and the workflow lanes in `ci-cd.md`; more are added as
   CI grows.
5. **Review-enforced** (weakest; minimize): only for properties no tool can
   check, each marked below.

## The rules

- **No `unsafe`, ever** (`unsafe_code = "forbid"`, tier 2). No exceptions; a
  need for `unsafe` is a design defect to solve differently.
  `unnecessary_safety_comment` and `unnecessary_safety_doc` deny a
  `// SAFETY:` comment or a `# Safety` doc section on safe code.
- **Fail loud, never wrap**: release builds run with `overflow-checks = true`
  so integer overflow panics instead of wrapping into a wrong value with no
  warning. On load-bearing arithmetic (index math, pagination offsets, retry
  counters) prefer explicit `checked_*` or `saturating_*` with a typed error; a
  panic is the backstop, not the design. Numeric-honesty lints back this at
  deny tier: `float_cmp_const`, `lossy_float_literal`, `as_underscore`,
  `fn_to_numeric_cast_any`, `ambiguous_negative_literals`, plus
  `integer_division` at warn.
- **The panic strategy is `unwind`, pinned in `[profile.release]`, never
  `abort`**: a clean 500 from the HTTP layer relies on
  `std::panic::catch_unwind`, which "only catches unwinding panics", and Cargo
  documents that tests IGNORE the `panic` setting, so an abort regression would
  be untestable by construction
  (<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#panic>). Keep
  `debug = "line-tables-only"` so a production panic names its file and line.
- **No `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!`/`unreachable!`/`unimplemented!`/`todo!` in
  application code** (deny-tier lints). Tests keep the `clippy.toml`
  `allow-*-in-tests` scoping; a panicking assertion is how a test fails.
  Recoverable failures return typed errors (`thiserror` in libraries, `anyhow`
  only in a binary), the Book ch9 split: panic is for states that cannot
  happen, `Result` for everything that can.
- **The ONE sanctioned escape for a logically-impossible `Err`/`None`** (Book
  ch9): a narrowly-scoped `#[expect(clippy::expect_used, reason = "…")]` on the
  smallest item, whose reason states the inspection proving unreachability,
  plus a *should*-phrased message (`.expect("the mapping should have been
  validated at load")`). Dodging the lint with `unwrap_or_default()` instead is
  FORBIDDEN: that converts a loud impossible state into a value the receiving
  system will store, the exact failure class this file exists to prevent.
- **No panicking indexing on request paths** (deny tier: `indexing_slicing`,
  `string_slice`): `.get(..)` or pattern matching over `x[i]` and `&s[a..b]`.
  `string_slice` panics on a UTF-8 boundary and clinical text is full of
  multi-byte content. Tests are scoped out via `clippy.toml`; a hot-path site
  PROVEN in-bounds uses the `#[expect]` escape above.
- **Guards are never silently dropped**: `let _ = lock/handle;` is denied
  (`let_underscore_drop` plus `let_underscore_lock`): bind guards to named
  variables that live to scope end. `unused_result_ok` (deny) closes the
  `.ok();` variant. Edition-2024 corollary (review-enforced): a guard or borrow
  produced in an `if let` scrutinee is dropped BEFORE the `else` branch runs
  (<https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2024/temporary-if-let-scope.html>);
  rewrite as `match` when the guard must span both arms.
- **An error carries its cause** (RFC 0201; `Error::source`). Every wrapping
  variant uses `#[source]` or `#[from]`; a stringified cause
  (`map_err(|e| Variant(e.to_string()))`) cannot be walked, matched, or logged
  structurally, the same silent-context-loss class this file legislates for
  `Result → Option`. There is no lint for it; new code carries the source and
  reviewers check for it. Two verified thiserror foot-guns: `#[source]` over an
  `Option<Box<…>>` yields the smart pointer as the source hop rather than the
  error inside it (hand-write `Display` and `Error` returning
  `self.source.as_deref()`), and `#[error(transparent)]` removes its own type
  from the chain, so a test walking the cause chain asserts the ROOT cause, not
  an intermediate wrapper type.
- **An upstream failure is never flattened into a success or a default.** The
  bridge calls remote servers on both sides, so this is its most likely
  silent-wrongness path: a refused call, a failed terminology lookup, a
  timeout, or a partially-written result is reported as a typed error carrying
  the upstream status and body, never absorbed into an empty value or a "best
  effort" outcome. (Review-enforced at the seam; the status-mapping tests pin
  the wire outcome.)
- **`Result → Option` inside a chain is a DECISION** (review-enforced; no lint
  can make the distinction). `.filter_map(|x| f(x).ok())` and `f(x).ok()?` turn
  an error into a missing element with no trace. The rule: a fallible
  conversion whose failure means "the input is DEFECTIVE" propagates a typed
  error; only one whose failure means "this input is legitimately ABSENT or not
  of this form" may become `Option`, and it carries a `// NOTE:` saying so. A
  probe where a parse failure IS the answer is the legitimate shape; a value
  silently swallowed while mapping a clinical field is the defect shape, and
  the two read identically, which is why judgment carries it.
- **Determinism is lint-backed** (deny tier: `iter_over_hash_type`): HashMap
  and HashSet iteration order is undefined; anything that feeds generated code,
  a serialized document, or an ordered result iterates ordered structures
  (`BTreeMap`, sorted vectors). Byte-determinism is a generator invariant
  (`codegen.md`) and a wire-parity requirement.
- **No debug or print output from libraries** (`dbg_macro`, `print_stdout`,
  `print_stderr` denied): libraries speak `tracing`; only a binary or a tool
  crate writes to stdio (crate-root `#![allow]`/`#![expect]` relaxations there,
  each with a reason). Clinical payload content never reaches a log or a
  `Debug` impl: log identifiers and shapes, never bodies (review-enforced).
- **Banned APIs are compile-time bans** (`clippy.toml` `disallowed-methods` and
  `disallowed-types`), populated when the workspace lands. The standing
  entries: one time library across the tree and the other banned by type, and
  `Option::as_slice`/`as_mut_slice` (on an `Option<Vec<T>>` receiver they yield
  `&[Vec<T>]`, a slice of 0-or-1 vectors rather than `&[T]`, and keep compiling
  after a field flips between `Vec<T>` and `Option<Vec<T>>`; spell it
  `.as_deref().unwrap_or_default()` or match). A legitimate exception site
  carries a scoped `#[expect(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason)]`.
- **Errors are types, not strings, at every boundary that branches**
  (C-GOOD-ERR): a caller that needs to distinguish outcomes gets an enum
  variant, not a substring match. String context belongs in the display text,
  not the discriminant.
- **Ids are distinct types where confusion is fatal** (C-NEWTYPE): an
  identifier from the openEHR side and an identifier from a target side are
  distinct newtypes, so the type system rejects a swapped-argument mistake at
  compile time. Never pass a bare `String` or `Uuid` where a typed id belongs,
  and never add a function that takes two adjacent bare-id parameters.
- **Every public item: documented, `Debug`, with concrete `# Errors` and
  `# Panics` sections** (C-DOC, C-DEBUG, C-FAILURE): `missing_docs`,
  `missing_debug_implementations`, `missing_errors_doc`,
  `missing_panics_doc`. A generated crate gets its docs from the emitter; never
  hand-edit a `// @generated` file to document it.
- **Visibility is deliberate** (C-STRUCT-PRIVATE): private by default, scoped
  visibility only at real module boundaries, zero re-exports (every import
  names its defining module), `unreachable_pub` watched at CI. Struct fields
  private unless the type IS a plain record.
- **Constructors and conversions follow the standard shapes** (C-CTOR,
  C-CONV): `new` and `with_*` builders, `From` and `TryFrom` over an ad-hoc
  `to_x()` where the conversion is total or fallible, getters without a `get_`
  prefix.
- **Blocking never hides in async**: no `std::sync` locks held across `.await`
  (clippy `await_holding_lock`), no synchronous I/O on the runtime.
  `spawn_blocking` for the rare CPU-heavy transform.
- **Dependencies are pinned, locked, and vetted**: workspace-table only, no new
  dependency for what the pinned set already provides, and verify the version
  against crates.io or docs.rs at the moment of adding. CI builds run
  `--locked`. A `cargo deny` gate is added when the Rust CI lanes are stood up.
- **Comment style is machine-enforced** (`comments.md`, RFC 505 plus RFC 1574):
  line comments only, `// TODO(#NNNN):` with a mandatory issue reference,
  `// NOTE:` as a citation plus one sentence (at most 3 lines), plain `//` runs
  at most 8 lines, `// SAFETY:` reserved for `unsafe`, and no unsanctioned
  marker vocabulary. Enforcement: `scripts/checks/comment-style.sh` (per-edit
  hook) plus `clippy::too_long_first_doc_paragraph`.
- **An HTTP status is compared as a `StatusCode`, never a number**
  (`rust-style.md` §HTTP statuses). Rendering the number stays legal; only
  comparison against a numeric literal is refused.
- **A field's default value lives inline in its struct's `Default` impl**
  (`rust-style.md` §Default values, the RFC 3681 shape). The per-field
  `#[serde(default = "path")]` form, a zero-argument `fn default_x()`, and a
  single-reader `const DEFAULT_X` are all banned.
- **Workflow security is audited** (`ci-cd.md`): pinned action digests,
  `permissions: {}` at workflow level, no context interpolation in a `run:`
  block, and `persist-credentials: false` on checkout. Enforced by the
  `actionlint`, `zizmor`, and `shellcheck` lanes, which run before any Rust
  exists.

## Deviations from the API Guidelines (deliberate)

- **C-PERMISSIVE is not followed: the Business Source License 1.1 for the
  project's own code** (the owner's decision, 2026-09-04, as FerroEHR and
  FerroTERM): free for non-production and non-commercial production use, a
  commercial licence for other production use, Apache 2.0 four years after
  each version. Vendored third-party material keeps its upstream terms
  (`vendored-inputs.md`).
- **C-STABLE: pre-1.0 dependencies are acceptable while the crates are
  unpublished.** If any crate is ever published, re-adjudicate every pre-1.0
  public dependency in its API first.

## When a lint fights a legitimate case

**`#[expect(lint, reason = "…")]` is the default suppression:** it self-reports
the moment the expectation stops being fulfilled
(`unfulfilled_lint_expectations`), so stale suppressions cannot accumulate.
`#[allow(lint, reason = "…")]` is reserved for cases where the lint fires only
in SOME configurations (cfg- or feature-dependent code, macro expansions). Both
forms MUST carry `reason = "…"` (`allow_attributes_without_reason` = deny).
Scope every suppression to the smallest item; a file- or crate-level
suppression needs the owner's sign-off in the PR.
