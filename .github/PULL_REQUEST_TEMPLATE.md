## Checklist

- [ ] Spec-facing decisions cite the governing specification (the openEHR Reference Model, the Archetype Object Model and ADL, ITS-REST, or AQL), not memory and not another implementation.
- [ ] Shell and workflow files are clean: `shellcheck --severity=style`, `actionlint`, `zizmor --min-severity=low .github/`.
- [ ] Rust gates pass, once a workspace exists: `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo nextest run --workspace --locked`, `cargo test --doc --locked`, `cargo doc` with `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings`, and `cargo deny check`.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an `[Unreleased]` entry, if the change is user-visible.
- [ ] Docs are updated, if behaviour changed.
- [ ] Every commit is signed.
- [ ] No AI or assistant attribution anywhere in the commits or this PR.
